I am a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Statistics in Kansas State University, studying Bayesian Statistics under the direction of [Dr. Gyuhyeong Goh](https://sites.google.com/site/bayesiangoh/). My research topic is "Bayesian solutions to high-dimensional data challenges using hybrid search". My current work is a GTA at Department of Statistics. Previously, I was a GRA at Institute of Computational Comparative Medicine, Kansas State Univeristy.
